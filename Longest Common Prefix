14. Longest Common Prefix — Notes

Goal:
Find the longest starting substring common to all strings.
If none → return "".

Idea (Why sorting works)

Sort the array.

Only compare first and last strings.

If they match at a position → all middle strings match too.

Code Logic
sort strings
take first and last
compare characters one by one
stop at first mismatch
return collected prefix

Key Lines Explained

v = sorted(v) → puts most different strings at ends

first = v[0], last = v[-1] → only these matter

min(len(first), len(last)) → avoid overflow

mismatch → stop immediately

Example

["flower","flow","flight"]
Sorted → ["flight","flow","flower"]
Compare "flight" & "flower" → "fl"

Complexity

Time: O(n log n)

Space: O(1) extra

Memory Hook

Sort → compare ends → build prefix → stop early
